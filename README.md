## Spin Defect Magnetometry 

My work is on deriving a fuctional for fitting to Electrically Detected Magnetic
Resonance (EDMR) and Near-Zero Field Magnetic Resonance (NZFMR) spectra. 

This involves deriving the *Spin Hamiltonian* for 4H-SiC, which is a 16x16
matrix, and solving the Stochastic Liouville Equation (SLE) that governs the
time-depedent evolution of the SiC system's density matrix.
